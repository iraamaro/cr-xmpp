  # Jabber ID or JID
  #
  # See [RFC 3920 Section 3 - Addressing](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html#addressing)
  #
  # An entity is anything that can be considered a network endpoint (i.e., an
  # ID on the network) and that can communicate using XMPP. All such entities
  # are uniquely addressable in a form that is consistent with RFC 2396 [URI].
  # For historical reasons, the address of an XMPP entity is called a Jabber
  # Identifier or JID. A valid JID contains a set of ordered elements formed
  # of a domain identifier, node identifier, and resource identifier.
  #
  # The syntax for a JID is defined below using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form
  # as defined in [ABNF]. (The IPv4address and IPv6address rules are defined
  # in Appendix B of [IPv6]; the allowable character sequences that conform to
  # the node rule are defined by the Nodeprep profile of [STRINGPREP] as
  # documented in Appendix A of this memo; the allowable character sequences
  # that conform to the resource rule are defined by the Resourceprep profile
  # of [STRINGPREP] as documented in Appendix B of this memo; and the
  # sub-domain rule makes reference to the concept of an internationalized
  # domain label as described in [IDNA].)
  #
  #     jid             = [ node "@" ] domain [ "/" resource ]
  #     domain          = fqdn / address-literal
  #     fqdn            = (sub-domain 1*("." sub-domain))
  #     sub-domain      = (internationalized domain label)
  #     address-literal = IPv4address / IPv6address
  #
  # All JIDs are based on the foregoing structure. The most common use of this
  # structure is to identify an instant messaging user, the server to which
  # the user connects, and the user"s connected resource (e.g., a specific
  # client) in the form of <user@host/resource>. However, node types other
  # than clients are possible; for example, a specific chat room offered by a
  # multi-user chat service could be addressed as <room@service> (where "room"
  # is the name of the chat room and "service" is the hostname of the
  # multi-user chat service) and a specific occupant of such a room could be
  # addressed as <room@service/nick> (where "nick" is the occupant"s room
  # nickname). Many other JID types are possible (e.g., <domain/resource>
  # could be a server-side script or service).
  #
  # Each allowable portion of a JID (node identifier, domain identifier, and
  # resource identifier) MUST NOT be more than 1023 bytes in size, resulting
  # in a maximum total size (including the "@" and "/" separators) of 3071
  # bytes.
